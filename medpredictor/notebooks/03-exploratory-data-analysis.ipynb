    "* The standard deviation for this feature is ~6.61. As we can see, this is a low value, so data's dispersion is low too.\n",
    "* The minimum index registered in this dataset is 12. This indicates us that at least one respondent has underweight,  which might require medical attention.\n",
    "* The maximum index registered in this dataset is 98. This is a less common index's value that could be due to errors in data entry.\n",
    "* The 50% of the respondets answered 27 as theirs body mass index, which is around the upper limit of the 'normal' BMI range  taking into account respondent's age and sex.\n",
    "* The 75% of the respondents ansewered 31 as theirs body mass index. According to respondent's age and sex, this could be dangerous. A BMI of 31 falls within the overweight or obese category, which can increase health risks.\n",

    "* The standard deviation for this feature is ~7.41, indicating high variability in the number of poor mental health days among respondents.\n",
    "* The high standard deviation suggests that while many respondents have few poor mental health days, a subset experiences significantly more, potentially requiring targeted mental health interventions.\n",
    "* The minimum number of days registered in this dataset is 0. This indicates that at least one respondent is in good mental health.\n",
    "* The maximum number of days registerd in this dataset is 30. This indicates that at least one person needs to take care of his/her mental health. \n",
    "* 75% of the respondents reported having 2 or fewer days of bad mental health.. This is very positive, because it indicates that the respondents are in good mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical illness or injury days in past 30 days (PhysHlth)**\n",
    "* The mean of 4 days suggests that, on average, respondents experienced physical illness or injury for about 4 days in the past month, which might be a concern depending on the nature and severity of these conditions.\n",
    "* The standard deviation for this feature is ~8.72. As we can see, this is a high value, so data's dispersion is high too.\n",
    "* The minimum number of days registered in this dataset is 0. This positive, because at least one respondent didn't suffer any illness or injury.\n",
    "* The maximum number of days registered in this dataset is 30. This indicates that at least one person suffered an illness or injury for 30 days.\n",
